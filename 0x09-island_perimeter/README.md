# Island Perimeter

## Description
This project contains a Python function, `island_perimeter(grid)`, that calculates the perimeter of an island in a grid. The grid is a list of lists of integers where:
- `0` represents water
- `1` represents land

The task is to find the perimeter of the island, considering that:
- The grid is completely surrounded by water.
- There is exactly one island (or no island).
- The island doesn't have any lakes (water inside that is not connected to the water surrounding the island).

## Requirements
- Python 3.4.3 or higher.
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7).
- You are not allowed to import any external libraries.
- All functions must be documented.
- All files must be executable.

## Files
### `0-island_perimeter.py`
Contains the function `island_perimeter(grid)` that calculates and returns the perimeter of the island.

### `0-main.py`
A test file to run the `island_perimeter()` function using a sample grid.

### `README.md`
